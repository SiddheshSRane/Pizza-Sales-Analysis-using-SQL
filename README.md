🍕 Unleashing Insights from Pizza Sales Data: SQL Data Analysis Project (Part 2) 🍕

Feeling accomplished after completing an exciting data analysis project on pizza sales using SQL! 🍕📊

In Part 2 of this project, I extracted valuable insights by querying a sales dataset and performing various analyses. Some key highlights:

✨ Calculated essential KPIs like total revenue, average order value, and total pizzas sold to gauge business performance.

📈 Uncovered temporal patterns, revealing peak order days (weekends) and hours (lunch and dinner times) through daily and hourly trend analyses.

🥗 Explored product performance, with veggie pizzas like the Supreme variety dominating overall sales, and large sizes being the customer favorite.

🏆 Identified the Classic Deluxe as the top-selling pizza and the Brie Carre as the least popular based on quantities sold.

Throughout the project, I demonstrated proficiency in SQL techniques such as data manipulation, aggregation, filtering, and querying. 

This experience has further strengthened my skills in extracting meaningful insights from data using SQL.

I'm thrilled to have contributed to optimizing pizza sales strategies through data-driven decision-making.
